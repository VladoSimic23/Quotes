This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app),  [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## API
This project is using [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/).

DummyJSON is a tool that generates realistic-looking placeholder data in various formats such as JSON, CSV, SQL, and more. It's useful for creating mock data for testing and development purposes. The generated data can be customized by using templates and options to match specific data requirements.

## Next JS
Next.js is a React-based framework that provides a set of tools and features for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications. It simplifies the process of creating complex React applications by providing features such as automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance. Additionally, it supports a wide range of plugins and integrations, making it a popular choice for building production-ready web applications.

## Typescript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to improve the development experience, catch errors earlier, and make code more scalable and maintainable. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, allowing developers to use it in any environment that supports JavaScript.

## Zustand
Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for managing complex application state, allowing developers to easily create and update stateful data without the need for boilerplate code or complex configuration. Zustand leverages the React Hooks API, making it easy to integrate with existing React codebases. Additionally, it provides advanced features such as middleware and devtools for debugging and optimizing state management in production.
